Description: The purpose of this R package is to help calculate the 
             differences in diameters measurements and leaf litter weights
             across multiple years of collected field site data. 
             These differences can help one understand and predict ecosystem
             health and productivity by looking at yearly diameter increases
             or a change in leaf litter biomass. This package can also take 
             this information and plot it using a liner model to better help 
             understand the relationship between rates of diameter increase 
             and leaf litter biomass.
